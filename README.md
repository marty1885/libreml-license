# libreml-license

A pair of copyleft and permissive licenses for ML model distribution

---

IANAL, but this is my attempt at making 2 licenses for distributing machine learning models

## PMLL - Permissie Machine Learning License

Modified ISC license. Under this license users of the model are allowed to do anything with the model.

## CLML - Copyleft Machine Learning

GPL like license that ensures the same freedom as GPL does

* Freedom to distribute
* Freedom to study
* Freedom to change
* Freedom to improve

Under this license. Anything and everything is permitted. However, you mush distribted the model if anyone asks for it.
